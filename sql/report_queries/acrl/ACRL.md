# Association of College and Research Libraries (ACRL) Report

These reports are used for pulling data that are reported on an annual basis to the Association of College & Research Libraries (ACRL).

The manner in which these reports are constructed can vary greatly from one library to the next. Therefore, a host of filter-point data elements must be included here in support of the widest variety of need within the FOLIO community.

ACRL reports are run once a year.

## Report Criteria

* A sum of total volumes
* A sum of total titles, broken down into the categories of "tangible" and "electronic."
* A sum of total expenditures, broken down into the categories of "one-time" and "ongoing."
* An accounting of "initial circulation" transactions, which includes charges only (no renewals)

To meet the report criteria, run the following four separate queries:

* [ACRL Volume Count Report](volume_count)
* [ACRL Title Count Report](title_count)
* [ACRL Collections Expenditures Report](collections_expenditures)
* [ACRL Circulation Report](circulation)
